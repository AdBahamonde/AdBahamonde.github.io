I am a Mechanical Engineering from Chile, later I finished a MsC in physics. I am currently working at INCAR (Interdisciplinary Center for Aqcuaculture Research), where we are currently studying the application of state space-based causality detection methods to epidemiological time series. Another project consists in the study of the role of turbulence on the emergence of Harmful Algal Blooms. 

My main research interest is hydrodynamic turbulence. On this topic I am particularly interested in the application of information theory to investigate the emergence of universal statistics in the transition to turbulence.
